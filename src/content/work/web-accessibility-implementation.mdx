			<a href="https://www.illumina.com" target="_blank">Illumina</a> faced increasing legal and compliance risks due to inaccessible digital experiences. Without standards or training, accessibility was inconsistently applied and often overlooked. To close these gaps, I led a company-wide accessibility initiative that set clear standards, created processes, and educated teams, ensuring accessibility became a foundation of Illumina.com.

I created Illumina's accessibility conformance report, educated teams across design, development, and content, validated work before launches, and continually advocated for accessibility across the company. I also wrote demo code to showcase the correct way to implement accessible solutions and modeled how accessibility could be embedded in everyday workflows."
