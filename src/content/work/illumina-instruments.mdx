			The instrument section of <a href="https://www.illumina.com" target="_blank">Illumina</a> showcases high-value sequencing systems, but the existing structure made it difficult for users to compare options or determine the best fit for their needs. I worked with cross-functional teams on a redesign to clarify the experience, improve wayfinding, and create a scalable foundation for current and future products.

		The instruments section had evolved without a unified strategy, leading to a disjointed user experience. Visitors struggled to find the right product or understand the differences between systems, and internal teams lacked alignment on structure and purpose. The challenge was creating clarity in a space filled with complexity—both technically and organizationally.

		We created a repeatable model that organized instruments consistently, highlighted differentiators, and clarified next steps. The redesign needed to reduce complexity for users while giving internal teams a structure they could maintain over time. To achieve this, we approached the project by focusing on:

		The redesigned instruments section launched as a consistent framework of templates and patterns. Instead of disjointed experiences, users could now explore instruments in a structured way, compare options directly, and take the next step with confidence. The redesign delivered:
