        The instrument section of Illumina.com showcases high-value sequencing systems, but the existing structure made it difficult for users to compare options or determine the best fit for their needs. I worked with cross-functional teams on a redesign to clarify the experience, improve wayfinding, and create a scalable foundation for current and future products.

      The instruments section had evolved without a unified strategy, leading to a disjointed user experience. Visitors struggled to find the right product or understand the differences between systems, and internal teams lacked alignment on structure and purpose. The challenge was creating clarity in a space filled with complexity—both technically and organizationally.

      To unify the user experience and support business goals, I introduced a modular design system that brought consistency across product pages while allowing flexibility for product-specific content. The new framework made it easier for users to find and compare instruments, while also improving internal alignment and long-term scalability.
