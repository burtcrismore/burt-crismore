		Illumina's brand and site design were dated. AEM templates lacked options to support marketing at scale. Patterns varied across sections, creating inconsistency and rework. The codebase relied on older libraries, hurting performance and slowing maintenance. Accessibility was not treated as foundational. Analytics needed broader coverage to understand behavior and support personalization across the site.

		This project showed me how important it is to bring people, process, and design together. The audits gave everyone a clearer picture, workshops built alignment, and performance testing helped me understand technical decisions more fully. Most of all, I saw how creative ops ties these pieces into a system that helps teams deliver with more clarity, confidence, and speed.
