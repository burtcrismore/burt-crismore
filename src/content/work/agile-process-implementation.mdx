			<a href="https://www.illumina.com" target="_blank">Illumina's</a> digital work ran in a waterfall style—requirements drifted, teams worked in silos, and QA hit a crunch at the end. I led the move to Agile so teams planned together, delivered in smaller slices, and made progress visible. The focus: clarity up front, predictable cadence, and clean handoffs.

		<ContentBlock

		/>
		Agile was more than a process change—it created a shared rhythm for how work moved from idea to release. Requirements were clearer, testing had the time it needed, and deployments became faster and less stressful. The steady cadence built confidence across design, development, QA, and content, replacing last-minute scrambles with a culture of predictability, collaboration, and continuous improvement.
