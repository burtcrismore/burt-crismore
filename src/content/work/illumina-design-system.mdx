			<a href="http://www.illumina.com" target="_blank">Illumina's</a> digital experiences were built in silos, with each team solving problems in its own way. Without shared standards, design and development duplicated work, slowed releases, and introduced defects late in the process. To improve speed and quality, Illumina needed a system to unify teams around a single source of truth—a scalable foundation that strengthened collaboration, reduced rework, and supported future growth.

		Without a shared framework, teams worked independently, creating redundant work and introducing risk. Projects often repeated the same problems, with inconsistencies surfacing late and extra effort required to fix them. These recurring issues created four main challenges that needed to be addressed.
