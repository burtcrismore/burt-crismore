			<a href="https://www.illumina.com" target="_blank">Illumina.com</a> lacked a structured QA practice. Bugs were caught in production, launches ran late, and teams had no documentation, defect tracking, or workflows. Introduced a Quality Management System that added structure to how projects were planned, tested, and released. By defining test cases, adopting Jira, and validating across devices, the digital team cut bugs, sped up launches, and gave stakeholders confidence in delivery.

		Behind the scenes, quality was almost invisible. There were no test cases to prove requirements were met, no defect logs to track issues, and no device coverage to ensure the site worked everywhere. Bugs slipped through until launch day, when teams scrambled to patch them in production. Deployments dragged on late into the night, draining resources and eroding trust. Quality was treated as optional rather than essential.

		Introduced a prevention-first approach to quality. Test cases were tied to requirements to ensure stakeholder needs were met. Jira became the central system for tracking and resolving issues, with structured workflows for ownership and accountability. A coverage matrix defined supported browsers and devices, and gates were built for design, development, and UAT. Testing expanded to include usability, privacy, and exploratory methods to safeguard the user experience.

		The Quality Management System turned quality into a repeatable discipline. Documentation outlined how to plan, test, and release. Jira became the system of record for tracking and resolution, while a browser and device matrix guided validation. User acceptance testing gave stakeholders visibility and confidence before launch. Together, these practices stabilized deployments and made delivery more predictable across teams.

		The Quality Management System transformed how illumina.com projects were delivered. By shifting validation earlier, teams cut release times in half and reduced defects that once reached production. Jira workflows and test cases created accountability and gave leadership visibility into progress. UAT built confidence with stakeholders, while device and browser coverage protected the user experience. Together, these changes made quality a shared success.

		/>
		Implementing a Quality Management System was painstaking at times, but it proved that discipline pays off. Defining requirements, documenting workflows, and running thorough tests felt tedious, yet those practices gave teams confidence and protected users. The biggest lesson was cultural—quality isn’t the job of one role, it’s shared. When everyone cares about quality, work moves faster and outcomes improve for both the business and the customer.
