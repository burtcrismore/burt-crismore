			<a href="https://www.illumina.com" target="_blank">Illumina</a> product launches involved multiple teams working in silos, each with their own tools and processes. Requirements were scattered across Jira tickets, Figma files, spreadsheets, and email threads, leading to missed deadlines, quality issues, and duplicated effort. To keep launches on track, we needed a single source of truth that aligned every discipline from kickoff through deployment.
