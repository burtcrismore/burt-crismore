				<ContentBlock
					subheading="How I got here"
				/>
				<p>I began my career in design and gradually expanded into front-end development, which gave me a deeper understanding of how ideas move from concept to reality. Over time, I was drawn to the systems behind the work—the workflows, tools, and decisions that shape how teams operate. That shift led me to design operations, where I help teams move with more clarity and confidence.</p>
			</Column>
			<Column class="last-p">
				<ContentBlock
					subheading="How I approach the work"
				/>
				<p>My approach centers on reducing ambiguity and making complexity manageable. Whether I'm designing an experience or leading an operational effort, I look for patterns, ask the right questions, and build frameworks that support momentum. It's not just about finishing the work—it's about making the process more thoughtful, collaborative, and effective for everyone involved.</p>
			</Column>
			<Column class="last-p">
				<ContentBlock
					subheading="What I aim to create"
				/>
				<p>The best work happens when people feel clear, connected, and trusted. I lead by communicating openly, planning ahead, and staying adaptable when things shift. My role is often part designer, part facilitator, part problem-solver—always focused on helping teams move forward with confidence and less friction.</p>
